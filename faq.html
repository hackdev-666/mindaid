            Q.  What do I do if the support doesnot help?
            
            It can be difficult to find the things that will help you, as different things help different people. It is important to be open to a range of approaches and
            to be committed to finding the right help and to continue to be hopeful, even when some things donot work out.

            It is often more realistic and helpful to find out what helps with the issues you face. Talking, counselling, medication, friendships, exercise, good sleep and 
            nutrition, and meaningful occupation can all help.

            Q.  What do I do if I am worried about my mental health?

            The most important thing is to talk to someone you trust. This might be a friend, colleague, family member, or GP. In addition to talking to someone, it may be 
            useful to find out more information about what you are experiencing. These things may help to get some perspective on what you are experiencing, and be the 
            start of getting help.

            it would be important to seek help.
